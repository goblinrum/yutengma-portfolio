# Personal Site
This personal site is based off the repository by [Lee Robinson](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io). It is a static site generated with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). 

## Getting Started
To start, have pnpm installed. Then run the following commands:
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## The Stack
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/)

The site itself is still under heavy construction. The design is to change soon<sup>TM</sup> to a custom design, provided I actually have time to sit down and do the design.

### A note about precommit (so I don't forget)
I'm using [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) to check this before making it public. I added a pre-commit locally to check using `pip install pre-commit` then `pre-commit install` with the current yaml config in the repo.
