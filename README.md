# Personal Site
This personal site is based off the repository by [Lee Robinson](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io). It is a static site generated with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). 

## Getting Started
To start, have pnpm installed. Then run the following commands:
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## The Stack
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/)
- [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/)

The site itself is still under heavy construction. The plan is to evetually move everything that's hardcoded into a database. Combined with a 
simple auth system, I should be able to log in and change all the fields. Other users can also log in and play around with my demo apps.
