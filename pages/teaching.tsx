                        <p> I am now a Lab TA for the Fall 2023 semester. In addition to my previous duties, I also help develop content for the course. This involves improving the current
                            lab material, lab reports, and lab notes for students.

                        <p> I am a Lab ASE for EECS16B for the Spring 2023 semester. This lab involves building the S1XT33N Robot Car (as outlined in my post <a href='https://yutengma.me/projects/sixteen' className='text-blue-600'>here</a>), 
                            and I am excited to teach students how to build their own robot car! I will update this page as the semester progresses.
